#Gapminder Data Analysis

#In this analysis, we will explore the gapminder dataset, which contains information about countries, their populations, GDP per capita, and life expectancy over time.
#Data Preparation

# Filter gapminder data for the year 2007 and arrange by descending life expectancy
gap_2007 = gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  arrange(desc(lifeExp))

# Filter gapminder data for the years 1952 and 2007 for Japan
gap_subset = gapminder %>%
  filter(year %in% c(1952, 2007), country == "Japan")

# Filter gapminder data for the year 1977 and arrange by descending life expectancy
gap_1977 = gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1977) %>%
  arrange(desc(lifeExp))

# Get a list of distinct years from the gapminder data
gap_years = gapminder %>%
  select(year) %>%
  distinct(year)

#Visualizing the Data

#Let's start by creating a plot of life expectancy over time for Afghanistan:

gapminder_plot <- gapminder %>%
  filter(country == 'Afghanistan') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Life Expectancy in Afghanistan over Time",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Life Expectancy")

gapminder_plot


#Visualizing the Data

#Let's start by creating a plot of life expectancy over time for Afghanistan, with a trend line and faceting by continent:

gapminder_plot <- gapminder %>%
  filter(country == 'Afghanistan') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ continent) +
  labs(title = "Life Expectancy in Afghanistan over Time",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Life Expectancy")
